## 🔗 Live Website

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a beauty-product themed website created with a different intention. Instead of promoting a product on the landing page, the website delivers a strong message about **real beauty**. The focus is shifted from appearance and fairness to values like confidence, kindness, and self-respect.

## 💡 Idea Behind the Project
The beauty industry often promotes unrealistic standards based on perfection and fairness. Through this project, I wanted to challenge that narrative.  
The website is designed to remind users that beauty is not defined by filters or skin tone, but by how we treat others and how we feel about ourselves.

## 🎯 What This Project Represents
- A reminder that **beauty goes beyond appearance**
- A creative blend of **social messaging and web development**
- A design-focused project with a meaningful purpose
- An attempt to reshape how beauty is presented online

This website is not just a portfolio project — it is a small step towards promoting self-confidence and positive values through design.
